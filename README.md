# Security---Cryptography
The crypto challenges progressively increase in difficulty, from the basics of XORing to  real-life cryptography.

This project is designed to teach you the basics of real life cryptography implementations and attacks.
It isgreatly inspired from cryptopals (or Matasano) challenges, huge shout-out for them. 
There is no cryptogra-phy nor advanced math background needed to complete the challenges.
It turns out that many modern crypto attacks donâ€™t involve much hard math.
You can choose among C, C++ and Python as a language to complete the exercises
